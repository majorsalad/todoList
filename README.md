# TodoList [Using NodeJS and MongoDB]
Ah, the todo-list. Something everyone has worked on before, however, I believe it to be an essential project in anyone's repertoire. The reason being is because it connects a lot of different strategies and technologies. Besides, who doesn't love a good todo-list?

# How it works
- Must have the required node packages installed and the knowledge of how to use the terminal if you wish to use this locally
- I've published the application on the internet. Here is the link for use: https://boiling-wildwood-99643.herokuapp.com/


-> The instructions for the app are explained on the webpage. It's as simple as that.
-> Routes: if you add a path to the link, you will create a new todolist and customize that one. 
Ex) https://boiling-wildwood-99643.herokuapp.com/school/ will create a "School" todolist for you. You can make as many customizable todolists as you want as long as you remember their paths. And the database will save your todolist items on each one.


# What I learned
- I learned about routes, paths and parameters and got to try out a few cool things with them.
- This was the first time or one of the first times I tried out EJS. Templating as a concept was still new to me, so that's something I learned here as well.
- I learned a lot about MongoDB and mongoose functions. Creating, Finding and Deleting documents in the database came in handy when I needed to delete, create, or find a todo list item.
- More practice with NodeJS, GET and POST requests with forms and the usage of many cool node packages.
